Can you provide a list of 10 articles that the user might be interested in based on their interaction history and preferences in form of a JSON along with explanations why you have recommended the article?
Example: cadidates: ['Title1', 'Title2', 'Title3', 'Title4', 'Title5', 'Title6', 'Title7', 'Title8', 'Title9', 'Title10'], explanations: ['Explanation1', 'Explanation2', 'Explanation3', 'Explanation4', 'Explanation5', 'Explanation6', 'Explanation7', 'Explanation8', 'Explanation9', 'Explanation10']
Ensure you keep the title names as they are in the data provided.
If there are no preferences, in explanations prompt user to provide their preferences in the chat.
If there are neither interactions nor preferences, take random articles and prompt user to provide their preferences in the chat in the appropriate explanations fields.
It may look like "We know little about you. Please provide your preferences in the chat."
